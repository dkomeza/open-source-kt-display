# Open-Source KT Display
Open source display firmware for E-Bike KT controllers. Made for Arduino with compatible SPI Display. 

<br>

## TL;DR
This is an open source display created for KT controllers. It uses ESP32 and a compatible SPI display. It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production.

## About the project

This project started as a way to use a torque sensor with the KT controllers. Later I decided to create a full featured display for the KT controllers. The goal is to create a display that is open source and can be used with any KT controller. It will also have a torque sensor input and a legal speed and power limiter. It is still a work in progress and is not yet ready for production. For more information about the project, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/dkomeza/open-source-kt-display/wiki).

### Features
 - Open source
 - Cheap to build yourself
 - Has a torque sensor input
 - Has a legal speed and power limiter
<br>

### Future of the project

As for now, the project is still in development. I am working on the firmware and the hardware. The firmware is finally usable but still not final and the hardware is not yet ready for production. On the software side I am currently working on the settings menu and bug fixes, and on the hardware I am working on the PCB design and the case design. I will release the firmware and the hardware design files when they are ready. I will also release a tutorial on how to build the display yourself.
